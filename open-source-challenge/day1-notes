# Day 1: GitHub Account Setup and Exploration

## What I Did:

-   Created a GitHub account.
-   Explored the GitHub interface (repositories, issues, and pull requests).
-   Created a special repository for my profile README.
-   Learned basic Markdown syntax for formatting the README file.
-   Customized my profile README to showcase my skills and a research paper.

The main takeaway was understanding how to create a professional online presence on GitHub.
