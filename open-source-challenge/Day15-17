Goal: Implement a robust Input Validation feature for the web application.

Key Contributions:
1-Repository Setup: Forked and cloned the repository. Created a feature branch named feature/input-validation-util for development.

2-Validation Logic (search4web.py):

-Created a new function, is_valid_input, to centrally manage all input checks.
-Implemented checks to ensure the phrase and letters fields are not empty, and verified that the letters field contains only alphabetical characters.
-Modified the main route (do_search) to use this function. If validation fails, it now logs the error and re-renders the input page with a friendly error message, preventing the application from attempting to process bad data.

3-Frontend Update (templates/entry.html):

-Updated the HTML template to display the server-side error message (the_error) if one is present.
-Ensured that the user's previously entered input is retained in the form fields after a validation error for a better user experience.
-Submission: Committed all changes and submitted a Pull Request (PR) to the upstream repository for review.
