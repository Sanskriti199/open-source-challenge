Issues
Issues are found under the Issues tab in a repository. They serve as a tracking system for tasks, bugs, and feature requests. They can be used to:

Report a bug you found in the code.

Request a new feature for the project.

Start a discussion about a project-related topic.

Issues are essential for project management and for tracking a project's progress.

Pull Requests (PRs)
Pull Requests are found under the Pull Requests tab. They are a way to propose and review changes to a repository's code. When you create a pull request, you are suggesting that the repository's maintainers should merge the changes from your branch into their main branch.

The typical workflow for a pull request is:

Create a new branch to work on your changes.

Make and commit your changes on that new branch.

Push the branch to GitHub.

Open a pull request on GitHub to ask for your changes to be reviewed and merged.
