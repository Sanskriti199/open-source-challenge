 Day 11-14 Open Source Contribution Summary
My goal was to complete 3 non-documentational code contributions in 3 separate repositories.

Completed Contributions
Contribution 1: Axe-Pearl/Mini-Projects

File: Calculator/cal.html

Fix: I made a refactor change. I fixed the HTML semantics by changing the calculator display element from an incorrect <h1> tag to the correct <p> tag. I also cleaned up the structure by properly grouping the decimal button (.).

Status: PR submitted on my branch, fix/cleanup-unused-import.

Contribution 2: DayZen-good-first-issue

File: DayZen/index.html

Fix: I performed a code hygiene cleanup. I removed a commented-out and unused CSS link (``) from the <head> section.

Status: PR submitted on my branch, fix-issue-16-temp-var-cleanup.

 Git Troubleshooting & Skills Used
I successfully practiced the full professional workflow and resolved key Git errors:

I always started work on a separate, descriptive branch using git checkout -b.

I learned to resolve the "failed to push" error by correctly using the --set-upstream flag (git push --set-upstream origin [branch-name]) to link my new local branch to the remote repository.

I resolved the fatal: pathspec error by troubleshooting the file path and using the correct relative path for staging (git add DayZen/index.html).

I used clear, categorized commit messages (refactor:, chore:) and referenced the GitHub Issue number to link my work.
