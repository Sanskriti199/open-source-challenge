What I Did-
I cloned my forked Hello-World repository to my local computer.

I created a new branch specifically for my changes.

I made a simple change to the README.md file.

I committed my changes locally, saving them as a checkpoint in my project's history.

I pushed my new branch and its changes from my local machine to my forked repository on GitHub.

I navigated GitHub's interface to find and view my changes on the new branch, confirming the push was successful.

What I Learned
The Local to Remote Workflow: I gained a practical understanding of how to take a project from GitHub, work on it locally, and then send my changes back to GitHub.

The Purpose of Branches: I learned that branches are essential for isolating my work, allowing me to make changes without affecting the main version of the project.

The Importance of Commits: I understood that commits are snapshots that track my changes and provide a clear history of my work.

The Difference Between Local and Remote: I learned the distinction between my local copy of the repository and the version hosted on GitHub, and how the push command bridges the two.

Basic Git Commands: I gained hands-on experience with key Git commands like git checkout -b, git add, git commit, and git push.
