Day 9: 
For this task, I focused on a code-based contribution to the pranaykgupta/GoodFirstIssue repository.

1-I found a beginner-friendly code change to make in the index.html file.

2-Made a Change: I modified the code to change a background color and added a missing <title> tag. This improved the aesthetics and functionality of the website.

3- I successfully used the core Git commands (add, commit, and push) to save and upload your changes to my personal fork.

4-I navigated GitHub to create your first pull request, proposing my code changes to the original project.

Day 10: 

For this task, I focused on a documentation-based contribution to the same pranaykgupta/GoodFirstIssue repository.

1- I noticed that the README.md file was minimal and decided to improve it.

2- I wrote a comprehensive README file that clearly explains the project's purpose and how to contribute, which is extremely helpful for other newcomers.

3- I used the same Git commands (add, commit, push) to upload my new documentation.

4- I successfully submitted a second pull request, this time for a documentation change.
