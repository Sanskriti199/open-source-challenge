Day 5: Forking and Cloning
Today's task was to understand the difference between forking and cloning and to practice both by creating a copy of a repository, making a change, and pushing it back.

Forking
Forking is creating a personal copy of a repository on GitHub. This allows you to work on a project without affecting the original. I forked the octocat/Hello-World repository to my own GitHub account, which created a copy at Sanskriti199/Hello-World.

Cloning
Cloning is the process of downloading a repository from a remote source (like GitHub) to a local machine (my computer). This gives me a working copy of the project on which I can make changes.

I used the git clone command to download my forked repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sanskriti199/Hello-World.git
Making and Saving Changes
After cloning, I navigated into the new folder and made a change to the README file. To save and sync this change back to my GitHub repository, I used these three Git commands:

git add README: This command staged the modified file.

git commit -m "Updated README with my name": This command saved a snapshot of my change with a descriptive message.

git push origin master: This command uploaded my local changes to my remote repository on GitHub.

These steps completed the cycle of forking, cloning, and contributing a change.
